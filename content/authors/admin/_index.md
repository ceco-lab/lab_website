# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am a plant ecologist and biostatistician, primarily interested in how the combination of evolutionary constraints and plant-environment interactions drive species coexistence along elevation gradients.By studying plant-environment interactions along elevational gradients through the lens of metabolomics, the major goal of my current research is to understand how plant metabolomes can be integrated into functional ecology to describe biotic interactions more accurately and to understand how the local environment constrains plant strategies, structures biodiversity, and shape landscape pattern. From a bioinformatic perspective, I am interested in leveraging big data generated by current state-of-the-art tools applied to ecological research via machine-deep learning approach.
